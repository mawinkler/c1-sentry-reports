# Sentry Reports Simplified (WIP)

This repo is work in progress and in early stages. Please be aware of this.

It describes currently the following variants to deal with Sentry reports:

- [How to feed reports to CloudWatch chronologically](docs/reports-to-cloudwatch.md)
- [How to download reports easily](docs/download-reports.md)
